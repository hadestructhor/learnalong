# Initialise a basic [Bun](https://bun.sh/) project

The first lesson is very easy !

You simply need to install bun, and for that, just follow along with their tutorial on their website.

Once that is done, create a repository named `learningalong` on your Github account or any other git hosting services (Gitlab, forgejo, gitea, gogs, anything you use and like).

Git clone that repository in your workspace.

Then simply run the following command:

```bash
bun init
```

You will be prompted to select whether you want a blank project, a react project or a library. Select Blank.

Stage all the files with `git add .`, commit them with `git commit -m "feat(init): initialise bun project` and push them onto the remote.

That's it ! You've finished the first lesson !
